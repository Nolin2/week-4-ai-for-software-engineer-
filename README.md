🚀 Tasks Overview
Part 1: Theoretical Analysis

Q1: AI-driven code generation reduces development time through automation and intelligent code suggestions.

Q2: Compared supervised vs unsupervised learning for bug detection.

Q3: Explained importance of bias mitigation in AI-driven UX personalization.

Case Study: AIOps improves deployment through predictive analysis and automation.

Part 2: Practical Implementation
🧠 Task 1 – AI-Powered Code Completion

Tool: GitHub Copilot

Compared AI-generated sorting code vs manual version.

AI code was more efficient and syntactically cleaner.

🤖 Task 2 – Automated Testing with AI

Tool: Selenium WebDriver

Automated login form testing with valid/invalid inputs.

Captured screenshots and automated responses.

AI improves test adaptability and coverage.

📊 Task 3 – Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation

Tool: Scikit-learn
Dataset: Kaggle Breast Cancer Dataset

Model: Random Forest

Accuracy: 96%

F1-Score: 0.96

Visualized model performance and results.

Part 3: Ethical Reflection

AI bias may occur in datasets with underrepresented groups.

Used IBM AI Fairness 360 principles for bias detection and mitigation.

Promotes fairness and transparency in predictive systems.

Bonus Task – Innovation Challenge

Proposed Tool: 🪄 AutoDocAI

Generates automated, clean documentation from codebases.

Uses NLP to summarize logic and structure into Markdown or HTML.

Saves developer time and enhances onboarding.
